#### To run
* Run the run.py file by running the command python run.py in the terminal
* Input the values in quotes " " as shown in the image above, except for the maximum file size input
* The output files will be generated without exceeding the file limit

#### Time Complexity
* Conisder the number of input files as N and number of lines in each file as M
* Time complexity of the program is: O(N*M)

#### Space complexity
* Consider the number of characters in each line as N
* Space complexity of the program is: O(N)
